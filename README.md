# Wallpapers
My wallpaper collection.

# Ideas
## 1. Programmatically generated wallpapers
I want to upload the source code of my wallpapers I generate in Python with pygame/turtle/pillow. (Maybe Rust+Nannou and others too)
Image outputs of the scripts only found in Releases.

## 2. Other wallpapers I find online
I don't want to store *any* images in this repo.
I'll store links, and only store the files themselves in Releases.
